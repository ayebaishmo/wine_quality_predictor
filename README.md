# Wine Quality Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various features. We utilize the Wine Quality dataset, which is freely available on the internet. This dataset contains essential features that significantly influence wine quality. Through the implementation of several machine learning models, we will predict the quality of wine samples.

## Dependencies
Before running this project, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- XGBoost (xgboost)

We recommend setting up a virtual environment to manage these dependencies to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. You can create a virtual environment using tools like `virtualenv` or `conda`. Here's an example using `virtualenv`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'venv' with your preferred name)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
wine_quality_predictor/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wqp.py/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wqp.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```
- `wqp.py/`: Python source code files for the wine quality predictor.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control (e.g., virtual environment folders, cache files).

## Running the Project
You can explore and run the project by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine_quality_predictor.git
   cd wine_quality_predictor
   ```

2. Activate your virtual environment (if you created one):

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the dataset, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

5. You can also run the Python scripts in the `src/` directory for specific tasks related to wine quality prediction.

## Dataset
The Wine Quality dataset contains features like acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. The target variable is the quality of the wine, which is a numerical score. You can use this dataset to train and test various machine learning models. Find the wine quality data set on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
